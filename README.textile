h1. Snorkle

Snorkle is a compilation of Ruby Audio libraries with examples. It was created by Noah Thorp to go along with his talk "Making Music With Ruby: Patterns, Context, Fun" at RubyConf 2009 and to make it easier for rubyists to explore methods of working on music and audio projects.

You can follow Noah's adventures on his "blog":http://www.aquabu.com and on "Twitter":http://www.twitter.com/aquabu. Also, if you are in the Bay Area you should checkout the "Bay Area Computer Music Technology Group":http://www.barcmut.org

h2. Libraries and Examples

Examples are in the /examples folder.

Snorkle makes use of lots of libraries from various sources. Some of the libraries are
referenced as gems (e.g. Bloopsaphone), some require explicit installation (e.g. Lilypad, Chuck) , and some are installed as
git submodules (e.g. Opaz-plugdk, Chuckr). For now just follow the install instructions - it's on the priorities
list to simplify the install.



h3. Chuck

h4. Non-Real Time Audio Rendering Using Chuck Example

Use lib/simple_render.ck to render non-realtime audio or realtime audio with command line arguments to Chuck.

* You can call chuck from the command line non-realtime using the -s (silent) flag.
* Call this file directly using: chuck -s simple_render.ck:'filename.wav':'80 2':'65 2':'67 2'
* Command line simple_render arguments are a series of strings seperated by ":". They consist of a MIDI note number followed by a duration in seconds. '60 2' would be a middle C lasting for 2 seconds.

h3. Opaz-plugdk
You can use the opaz-plugdk ruby api to compile Java VST plugins that can be run by the jVSTwRapper

This is a little complicated.

- Install the Java jVSTwRapper: http://jvstwrapper.sourceforge.net/
- opaz plugdk is installed as a git submodule in Snorkle. You can clone it directly "here":http://github.com/thbar/opaz-plugdk

h3. Lilypond

"download":http://lilypond.org/web/install/ or install as a port on mac with:
sudo port install lilypond


h3. Bloopsaphone

Bloopsaphone is a great little Ruby library written by _Why The Lucky Stiff and friends for playing Chip Tunes.

h4. *Installing Bloopsaphone on OSX*

"bloopsaphone":http://github.com/whymirror/bloopsaphone - Why The Lucky Stiff

sudo port install portaudio
sudo gem install why-bloopsaphone
