h1. Snorkle

Snorkle is a compilation of Ruby Audio libraries with examples. It was created by Noah Thorp to go along with his talk "Making Music With Ruby: Patterns, Context, Fun" at RubyConf 2009 and to make it easier for rubyists to explore methods of working on music and audio projects.

You can follow Noah's adventures on his "blog":http://www.aquabu.com and on "Twitter":http://www.twitter.com/aquabu. Also, if you are in the Bay Area you should checkout the "Bay Area Computer Music Technology Group":http://www.barcmut.org

h1. Libraries and Examples

Examples are in the /examples folder.

Snorkle makes use of lots of libraries from various sources. Some of the libraries are referenced as gems (e.g. Bloopsaphone), some require explicit installation (e.g. Lilypad, Chuck) , and some are installed as git submodules (e.g. Opaz-plugdk, Chuckr). For now just follow the install instructions - it's on the priorities list to simplify the install.

Install snorkle by doing the following:
$ git clone git@github.com:aquabu/snorkle.git
$ cd snorkle
$ git submodule init


h2. Chuck


h3. Non-Real Time Audio Rendering Using Chuck Example

Use lib/simple_render.ck to render non-realtime audio or realtime audio with command line arguments to Chuck.

* You can call chuck from the command line non-realtime using the -s (silent) flag.
* Call this file directly using: chuck -s simple_render.ck:'filename.wav':'80 2':'65 2':'67 2'
* Command line simple_render arguments are a series of strings seperated by ":". They consist of a MIDI note number followed by a duration in seconds. '60 2' would be a middle C lasting for 2 seconds.

h2. Chuckr

A ruby wrapper for chuck. To install you will need to go to lib/submodules/chuckr and run:
rake chuck:setup env=osx          # compile/install chuck binary (osx|osx-ppc|linux-oss|linux-jack|linux-alsa)

h2. Scruby
