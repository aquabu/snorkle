h3. Chuck Examples

h4. Non-Real Time Audio Rendering Using Chuck Example

Use examples/chuck/simple_render.ck to render non-realtime audio or realtime audio with command line arguments to Chuck.

* You can call chuck from the command line non-realtime using the -s (silent) flag.
* Call this file directly using: chuck -s simple_render.ck:'80 2':'65 2':'67 2'
* Command line simple_render arguments are a series of strings seperated by ":". They consist of a MIDI note number followed by a duration. '60 2' would be a middle C half note.
