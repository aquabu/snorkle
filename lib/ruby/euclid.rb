# A class for spacing a number of ones over a range of zeros as evenly as possible using the Euclidean algorithm.

# Special thanks to Wesen for bringing Euclidean sequencing to my attention and forging the way using Lisp:

# Usage:
# require "/path/to/net.mattbot.class.euclidean_sequencer.rb"
# pulses = 8
# hits = 5
# thisEC = EuclideanSequencer.new()
# p thisEC.generate(hits,pulses)
#
# Oontz!
